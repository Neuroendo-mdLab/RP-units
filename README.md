# RP-units

#Overview
 RP-unit is an automated animal behavior recording system using Raspberry Pi, which enables you remotely perform video-recording of animal behavior. It also frees you from laborious procedures such as file-naming, encoding and transferring the files to a storage.
Thus, by using RP-units, behavioral recordings will be performed more efficiently and accurately, without unintentional human errors caused by experimental operations.
